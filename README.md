# Haiku Bot

DESCRIPTION
-----------
HaikuBot is a simple command-line application that generates haikus.
The program offers random haiku generation and will soon support custom
topic-based haiku creation.

USAGE
-----
1. Generate new haiku
   - Choose to input a topic or get a random haiku
   - Random haikus are selected from pre-written collection in its current state (more to come in the future...)
   * Using random haiku is currently faster since it's haikus are pre-generated, however using the first option allows more freedom to have it generate a topic related to the user input.

2. View documentation
   - Displays this help text

3. Exit
   - Closes the program

COMMANDS
--------
At the main menu, enter numbers 1-4 to select your desired action.
When generating a haiku, enter 1 for custom topic or 2 for random.

NOTES
-----
- Invalid inputs will prompt you to try again
- The program processes one command at a time
- Wait times are built in to prevent command flooding

Thank you for using Haiku Bot! We hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy making it.
